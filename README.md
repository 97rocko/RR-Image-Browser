# Image Browser

Type in an @ name and press load to view a user's photo feed or photo library (Public photos only).  Use the button to the left of the textbox and load button for toggling between "oldest to newest" and "newest to oldest."  

You can favorite up to 3 @ names which will show up in a drop down below the @ name textbox.  Additionally the last 5 usernames entered will be preloaded in this dropdown.  This data will persist between opening/closing of the application.

The photo grid utilizes lazy loading so images are only loaded when they enter the view port.

Click on an image in the grid to view more information on the photo.
- After clicking on an image for more info you can click on the URL to view it on Rec.net  Clicking the link will open it up in the systems default browser.

Not all old images will have image data.  When viewing images from 2017 - early 2018 you will notice the 'activity' will often be unknown or undefined.  Rec Room did not save activity data during these periods of time.

If you would like to clear out the photo grid view you can simply remove the @ name from the textbox and press the load button again.  This will then clear out the grid.

##  Filters
